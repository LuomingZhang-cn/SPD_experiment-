# SPD_experiment-
This repository contains the code for simulating and analyzing the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma (SPD) game. The simulation explores how various factors, such as the number of rounds and access to payoff information, influence the cooperation and decision-making strategies of LLM agents.
