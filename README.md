# SPD_experiment
This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma (SPD) game. The simulation examines how various factors, such as the number of rounds and access to payoff information, influence the cooperation and decision-making strategies of LLM agents.

## Key Features:
1. Simulates agent interactions in a spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game.

2. Examines the impact of factors like the number of rounds and payoff transparency on cooperative behavior.

3. Uses Python and integrates external APIs (e.g., DeepSeek API) for agent-based interaction.

## Setup & Requirements:
1. Google Colab Environment:
The code in this repository was written and tested in Google Colab. For the best compatibility and experience, it is recommended to run the code directly in Colab.

2. API Keys:
Before running the code, you will need to apply for and configure your own API keys (e.g., DeepSeek API key) as required for certain functionalities.

3. Google Drive Integration:
If you need to read from or write to files stored in Google Drive, it is recommended to mount your Google Drive in Colab. 

## Resource and Time Limitations:
Keep in mind Colabâ€™s resource and time limitations, especially for long-running experiments or large-scale tasks. It is highly recommended to regularly save your data and results.
